##  How it works

Choose game mode
  
  Computer Easy
  Computer Hard
  Play against a freind
  
### Play against a friend mode:

The game starts with player 1 making the first move with character "X". Player 2 then makes the next move with character "O" and players repeatedly take turns until one player wins with three of their characters in a row.

### Computer Easy mode: 

Choose whether you want to be player 1 or player 2. If you are player 2, computer has first move. Otherwise you have first move. The rest of the game goes as usual
